# **Surf's Up Module 9 Challenge** #

## Overview ## 
We are looking to build a surf shop in Oahu and one of our investors W.Avy has asked us to analyze the weather data for the island to determine if the weather is condusive to having a surf shop as his last surf shop didn't survive because there was too much percipitation. We took the weather data in SQL and got the summary statistics for the temperatures in June and December. Based on this data, we can let W.Avy know whether the weather is suitable for the surf shop. 

## Key Differences between June and December ##

 - The max temperature from June  is 85 degrees while the max temperature for December is 83. This is not a large range of difference between the two months. 
 - The average(mean) temperature in June is 74.9 degrees while December is 71 degrees. This is only about a 4 degree difference between the two months. 
 - The temperature statistic that has the most difference is the min temperature where June was 64 degrees and Decemeber was 56 degrees which is a much bigger swing of 8 degrees. 

## Summary ## 
Given the data for the two months of June and December, we can see that the two months are quite similar temperature wise with just a slight variability of about 4 degrees. This would lead us to believe that the weather is somewhat stable and could allow for a surfing business to be successful in Oahu. 

Two additional queries that we could perform to help with the analysis would be to find the amount of days per year and per month without rain/percipitation which could tell us how many business days we would likely see throughout the year. We could also analyze the average temperatures across all months of the year and find a range of what ideal surfing temperatures would be that would also tell us how many business days are likely throughout the year and not just two months of data as a business needs to be successful operating all 12 months of the year.
